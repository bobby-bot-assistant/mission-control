## The Problem We're Solving

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 73% of children experience sleep problems | Foundation for mental health issues |
| Existing solutions are passive media | No therapeutic engagement |
| No clinically-validated bedtime interventions | Underserved prevention opportunity |
| Parents seek screen alternatives | Market demand exists |

## The Solution

**Story Hour with Simon** is a hybrid live-action + animated bedtime series featuring Simon, a character who guides children through calming routines while actively engaging parents.

### Key Features

1. **Parent Handoff System™**
   - Every episode ends with the parent, not the screen
   - Guided breathing, stretching, conversation prompts
   - 5-minute co-regulation ritual

2. **Multiple Completion Modes**
   - Parent-led reading (Simon narrates, parent shows)
   - Audio-guided (ambient mode, no screen required)
   - Full video experience

3. **Adaptive Engagement**
   - Real-time emotional state detection (optional)
   - Pacing adjusts to child's engagement signals
   - Repeat-friendly structure

4. **Clinical Foundation**
   - Built on pediatric sleep science
   - Co-regulation theory basis
   - Measurable outcomes

## MVP Scope (Phase I Ready)

### What Needs to Be Built

| Component | Effort | Priority | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 3 Complete Episodes (pilot) | High | Critical | Not started |
| Simon Character Design | Medium | High | Not started |
| Parent Handoff System™ Script | Medium | Critical | Not started |
| Technical Prototype (1 scene) | Medium | High | Not started |
| Usability Study Protocol (30 families) | Low | Critical | Not started |

### What Needs to Be Researched

| Item | Purpose | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
