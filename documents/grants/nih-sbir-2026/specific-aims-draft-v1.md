## SPECIFIC AIMS

The pediatric mental health crisis has reached epidemic proportions, with 1 in 5 children experiencing a diagnosable mental health disorder and 80% lacking access to needed services. Concurrently, excessive screen time and algorithmically-driven media consumption are exacerbating attention deficits, emotional dysregulation, and family disconnection. Traditional mental health interventions cannot scale to meet population-level demand, while existing children's media often compounds rather than alleviates these challenges.

**Story Hour with Simon** represents a paradigm shift: therapeutic media designed from the ground up to deliver evidence-based mental health support through entertainment families already choose. By combining cinematic storytelling, AI-powered personalization, and structured co-viewing protocols, we transform passive screen time into active emotional skill-building.

Our preliminary pilot with 1,000+ families across neurodiverse and underserved communities demonstrated 96% satisfaction rates, 90% willingness to pay, and significant improvements in bedtime transitions, emotional regulation, and parent-child bonding. This SBIR Phase I will rigorously validate these outcomes through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in partnership with Boston Children's Hospital Digital Wellness Lab.

**We propose the following Specific Aims:**

### Aim 1: Develop and refine the Story Hour with Simon therapeutic media prototype

We will produce 6 pilot episodes (7-10 minutes each) of our flagship bedtime series, incorporating:
- **Narrative therapeutic techniques** validated for emotional regulation and anxiety reduction
- **AI-powered personalization engine** that adapts prompts based on child responses and family dynamics
- **Multi-modal engagement system** including second-screen activities, parent coaching, and progress tracking
- **Accessibility features** for neurodiverse audiences (sensory-friendly options, visual supports, multiple languages)

**Deliverables:** Functional prototype with 6 episodes, personalization algorithm, parent dashboard, and clinical measurement integration

### Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial measuring clinical outcomes

In partnership with Boston Children's Hospital, we will conduct a 12-week RCT with 200 families (100 intervention, 100 waitlist control) measuring:
- **Primary outcomes:** Sleep quality (PSQI-C), emotional regulation (BRIEF-2), parent-child interaction quality (PCIQ)
- **Secondary outcomes:** Screen time reduction, bedtime routine adherence, parental stress (PSI-4)
- **Engagement metrics:** View completion, activity participation, sustained use patterns
- **Subgroup analyses:** Outcomes by neurodevelopmental status, socioeconomic factors, and baseline symptom severity

**Deliverables:** Peer-reviewed publication of RCT results, clinical validation data for Phase II

### Aim 3: Establish commercialization pathway and implementation framework

We will develop a sustainable business model combining B2B institutional licensing and D2C subscriptions:
- **Institutional partnerships:** Pilot implementations with 3 healthcare systems and 2 school districts
- **Reimbursement strategy:** CPT code mapping and insurance coverage pathway analysis
- **Distribution framework:** Integration with pediatric care workflows and family engagement protocols
- **Phase II planning:** Scalability assessment and multisite trial design for $2M Phase II application

**Deliverables:** Commercialization plan, letters of intent from institutional partners, Phase II application

## INNOVATION

Story Hour with Simon innovates across multiple dimensions:

1. **First therapeutic media designed as prevention, not intervention:** Unlike apps that require identified symptoms, our content works for all families while delivering clinical benefits
2. **AI that enhances human connection, not replaces it:** Our personalization engine strengthens parent-child bonds rather than isolating children with devices
3. **Entertainment-first, therapy-embedded:** Families engage because content is genuinely entertaining, with therapeutic elements seamlessly integrated
4. **Scalable mental health infrastructure:** Delivers evidence-based support at population scale without requiring clinical workforce expansion

---

## SIGNIFICANCE

This project addresses the intersection of three converging crises:

1. **The pediatric mental health emergency:** With 7.5-week average wait times and critical workforce shortages, new delivery modalities are essential
2. **The screen time crisis:** Currently being litigated in LA County Superior Court, with Meta and YouTube facing lawsuits from 1,000+ families and 250+ school districts for addictive design harming children
3. **The AI transformation of childhood:** As AI reshapes how children learn and develop, we need frameworks that leverage AI for mental health support rather than exploitation

By validating therapeutic media as a scalable mental health intervention, this project could fundamentally reshape how we deliver preventive mental health support to millions of children and families.
