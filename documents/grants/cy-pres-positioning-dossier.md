# Cy Pres Positioning Dossier
## Mindful Media Foundation - Social Media Litigation Settlement Recipient
### Living Document - Updated February 6, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Mindful Media Foundation is uniquely positioned to receive cy pres awards from social media mental health litigation settlements. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit building preventative mental health infrastructure specifically addressing screen-time related harms to children, we represent the ideal "next best use" of settlement funds that cannot be distributed to individual class members.

**Key Qualifications:**
- Direct mission alignment with harmed class (children affected by social media)
- Evidence-based solution to the specific harms alleged (addiction, mental health)
- Institutional validation (Boston Children's Hospital research partnership)
- Existing infrastructure ready to scale (platform built, content in production)
- Geographic alignment (LA-based, where trial is occurring)
- Preventative approach addressing future harm, not just past damage

## Cy Pres Legal Framework

### Definition
Cy pres (from French "cy pres comme possible" - "as near as possible") is a legal doctrine that allows courts to redirect class action settlement funds to charitable organizations when direct distribution to class members is impractical or impossible.

### When Cy Pres Applies
1. **Class too large for individual distribution** ✓ (millions of affected children)
2. **Individual damages too small to distribute efficiently** ✓ (administrative costs exceed individual payments)
3. **Class members cannot be identified/located** ✓ (many affected children not documented)
4. **Ongoing/future harm needs addressing** ✓ (children still using platforms)

### Legal Standards for Recipients
- Must serve interests of the harmed class
- Geographic nexus to litigation preferred
- Established track record and infrastructure
- Transparent governance and financial controls
- No conflicts of interest with defendants
