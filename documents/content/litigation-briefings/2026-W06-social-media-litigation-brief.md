## Bobby's Talking Points

**For Content This Week:**

**Hook Options:**
- "Day 8 of the trial, and Meta just admitted they prioritized watch time over wellbeing"
- "Internal documents show they knew. They just didn't care."
- "While they defend addiction in court, we're building the cure"

**Key Messages:**
1. **The harm is now legally documented** - This isn't speculation anymore
2. **Engagement ≠ Wellbeing** - Their entire model is built on the wrong metric
3. **Prevention > Litigation** - Suing doesn't heal kids; infrastructure does
4. **We're ready** - Boston Children's validation, 1000+ families, proven outcomes

**Call to Action:**
- "The trial proves the problem. We've built the solution."
- "Courts will fund prevention. We're positioned to deliver."
- "Join us in building mental health infrastructure, not just assigning blame."
