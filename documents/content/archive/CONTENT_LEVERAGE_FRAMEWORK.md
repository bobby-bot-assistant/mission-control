## Decision Framework: What Content to Create?

### Question 1: Does this create an ASSET or CONSUMABLE?

**ASSETS (build these):**
- Research methodology documentation (reused forever)
- Framework definitions (cited forever)
- Case studies (referenced forever)
- Tool/calculator (used forever)

**CONSUMABLES (create sparingly):**
- Blog posts (consumed once)
- Social media content (consumed once)
- Generic thought leadership (consumed once)

### Question 2: What is the COMPOUND MULTIPLIER?

| Multiplier | Content Type | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 10x | Framework | "Family Media Design Principles" - cited by others |
| 5x | Tool/Prototype | GrantScout - users return repeatedly |
| 3x | Research Paper | Academic citation, grant support |
| 2x | Case Study | Sales enablement, credibility |
| 1x | Speaking | One-time audience reach |
| 0.5x | Blog Post | Time investment > value created |

### Question 3: What unlocks DOWNSTREAM OPPORTUNITIES?

```
Research Paper (10x)
    ↓
Cited by others → Academic credibility → Grant funding → Institutional sales
    ↓
Whitepaper (5x)
    ↓
Thought leadership → Consulting opportunities → Partnership discussions
    ↓
Case Study (3x)
    ↓
Social proof → Sales conversations → Revenue
```

## Prioritization Scoring

For any content decision, score 1-5:

```
PRIORITY = (Leverage_Multiplier × 3) + (Revenue_Potential × 2) + (Downstream_Value × 2) + (Effort_Recovery × 1)
```

**Score > 20:** DO IMMEDIATELY  
**Score 12-20:** DO THIS MONTH  
**Score < 12:** SKIP OR DELEGATE

- [ ] Is the effort/revenue ratio favorable?

If YES to 3+ → DO IT
