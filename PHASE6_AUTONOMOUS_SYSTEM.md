# Phase 6 — Autonomous Operating System

*Chief of Staff + Systems Architecture Mode*

**Created:** 2026-02-05  
**Status:** Active

## Core Operating Principle

Strategic Decision Engine (SDS) is now the core operating system. All work flows through Mission Control. Chat is ephemeral.

## SDS Formula

```
SDS = (Revenue × 2) + (Alignment × 2) + (Leverage × 1.5) + (TimeFit × 1) - (CognitiveLoad × 1)
```

| Score | Result | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 25 | YES | Execute immediately |
| 18-24 | PROBABLY | Schedule this week |
| 12-17 | LATER | Put in backlog |
| < 12 | NO | Decline or ignore |

## Pipelines

### Revenue Pipeline
Grant Opportunity → SDS → Decision → Task → Artifact → Grant → Memory

### Content Pipeline  
Content Idea → Leverage Check (multiplier ≥ 2?) → SDS → Creation → Distribution → Authority

### Decision Pipeline
Input → SDS → Decision → Outcome → Memory → Future Decision

## Nightly Autonomous Loop

1. **CHECK** Activity Feed, Decision Outcomes, Task Queue, Opportunity Backlog
2. **BUILD** Revenue work > Leverage systems > Operational maintenance
3. **DECIDE** What to work on next (using SDS)
4. **LOG** Decisions, completions, memories, blockers, tomorrow's priorities
5. **DELIVER** Morning Packet by morning
6. **REPEAT**

## Standing Authority

**Pre-approved:**
- Create internal systems, frameworks, code
- Populate Mission Control (Projects, Tasks, Memories, Documents)
- Refactor internal tools for leverage/clarity
- Fix own failures and log them

**Hard constraints:**
- No external actions
- No public repos, services, outreach, spending
- No feature expansion beyond Mission Control

## Status

Ready for autonomous operation. Idle until further instruction.
