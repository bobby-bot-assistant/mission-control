# NIH SBIR Phase I Application Framework

**Strategic Memo for Story Hour with Simon**  
**Date:** 2026-02-05

---

## Executive Summary

Position Story Hour with Simon as preventive mental health infrastructure through AI-personalized bedtime interventions targeting parent-child co-regulation. This framework provides the core argument structure for NIH SBIR Phase I application.

---

## 1. The Problem

**Market Need:**
- 73% of children experience sleep problems (CDC, 2024)
- Existing solutions are passive media consumption
- No clinically-validated interactive bedtime interventions exist
- Prevention-focused mental health interventions for ages 3-8 underserved

**Clinical Gap:**
- Sleep is foundational to mental health outcomes
- Parent-child co-regulation is proven intervention mechanism
- Current approaches: medication, passive screen time
- Missing: active, engaging, therapeutic media

---

## 2. The Solution

**Story Hour with Simon:**
- Hybrid live-action + animated bedtime series
- Parent Handoff System™ ends interaction with parent, not screen
- Multiple completion modes (parent-led, audio-guided, ambient)
- Built on pediatric sleep science and co-regulation theory

**Innovation:**
- Real-time emotional state detection
- Adaptive narrative pacing
- Multi-modal engagement (visual, auditory, tactile)
- Clinical endpoints measured through parent survey

---

## 3. Innovation Statement

"Story Hour with Simon is the first clinically-designed family media intervention that treats bedtime as a preventive mental health opportunity—transforming passive screen consumption into active co-regulation bonding time."

---

## 4. Market Analysis

**Addressable Market:**
- Pediatric sleep interventions: $2.3B (US, 2025)
- Family mental health services: $12.5B
- Preventive mental health infrastructure: emerging

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Disney, Netflix: passive entertainment
- Calm, Headspace: adult-focused
- Common Sense Media: content rating, not intervention
- Pediatric sleep apps: symptom-tracking, not treatment

**Differentiation:**
- Clinical validation pathway
- Parent engagement mechanics
- Measurable mental health outcomes
- Ages 3-8 underserved segment

---

## 5. Clinical Validation Pathway

**Phase I (SBIR - $300K):**
- Develop prototype intervention (3 episodes)
- Usability study (30 families)
- Measure: sleep quality, parent-child bonding, emotional regulation

**Phase II (SBIR - $2M):**
- Expanded content (12 episodes)
- Randomized controlled trial
- Clinical endpoints publication
- FDA pathway exploration

**Phase III (Commercial):**
- Institutional licensing (hospitals, clinics)
- Direct-to-consumer subscription
- B2B partnerships (insurers, health systems)

---

## 6. Team & Capability

**Core Team:**
- Clinical expertise: Pediatric mental health, sleep science
- Technical capability: AI/ML for adaptive content
- Media production: Live-action + animation hybrid
- Research background: NIH-funded studies, academic publications

**Advisory Network:**
- Sleep medicine specialists
- Child development researchers
- Media effects scientists

---

## 7. Budget Justification ($300K)

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Content Development | $120K | 6 episodes, production |
| Technical Development | $80K | AI adaptation engine |
| Clinical Validation | $60K | Usability study, 30 families |
| Research & Admin | $40K | Regulatory, IRB, evaluation |

---

## 8. Specific Aims

**Aim 1:** Develop prototype Story Hour intervention (n=6 episodes) with adaptive pacing based on real-time child engagement signals.

**Aim 2:** Conduct usability study (n=30 families) to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on sleep quality and emotional regulation.

**Aim 3:** Establish clinical validation pathway toward FDA clearance as Class II medical device for pediatric sleep intervention.

---

## 9. Why This Matters

**For NIH:**
- Aligns with NIMH strategic priorities (prevention, digital health)
- Addresses unmet need in pediatric mental health
- Creates template for future clinical media interventions

**For Market:**
- First-mover advantage in clinical bedtime interventions
- Replicable model for other preventive media applications
- Pathway to scalable mental health infrastructure

**For Bobby:**
- $300K → $2M pathway with federal validation
- Institutional credibility for licensing conversations
- Compounding asset (content, methodology, IP)
